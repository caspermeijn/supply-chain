All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.

As noted in the changelog, this version produces different output for a given seed.
The documentation did not mention stability. It is possible that some uses relying on
determinism across the update would be broken.

The new constants do appear to match WyRand v4.2 (modulo ordering issues that I have not checked):
